    description:
      "I performed a multi-model regression analysis in R to explore how various factors influence levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. I used `lm()` for model fitting, and applied diagnostic tests such as VIF to check multicollinearity, Durbin-Watson for autocorrelation, and Breusch-Pagan for homoskedasticity. The anxiety model showed both autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity, while other models passed diagnostic checks. I handled outlier detection and validated model assumptions to ensure statistical reliability.",

    description:
      "I analyzed user comments from Stack Overflow to uncover trends in programming languages and development practices. Using R, I applied text mining techniques including frequency analysis, word cloud generation, 4-word N-gram modeling, and sentiment analysis. The most frequent terms were 'using', 'code', and 'error', indicating users often seek help with library or function usage. Sentiment analysis revealed a dominance of negative expressions, highlighting error-driven frustrations in developer interactions. The project followed a full data mining pipeline: problem definition, data understanding, preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.",
